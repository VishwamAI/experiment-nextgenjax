# Time-Aware Observation Wrapper Test Implementation

# This script is responsible for implementing the test for the time-aware observation wrapper.
# The test ensures that the wrapper correctly modifies the observation space to include time as a factor.

def test_time_aware_observation():
    # Placeholder for the time-aware observation wrapper test
    pass

# The actual logic and algorithms for the test will be implemented in accordance with the user's specifications.
# This test will ensure that the time-aware observation wrapper is robust and functions correctly.
