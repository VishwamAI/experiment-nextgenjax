# ImportError Issue with `reverb` and TensorFlow

## Description of the Problem
We are encountering an ImportError when attempting to import the `reverb` library, which is DeepMind's replay buffer library, in our project. The error message indicates that the `reverb` library is unable to find the required symbols inside TensorFlow, specifically mentioning an undefined symbol related to TensorFlow's TensorProto.

## Error Message
```
ImportError: 
Attempted to load a reverb dynamic library, but it could not find the required
symbols inside of TensorFlow.  This commonly occurs when your version of
tensorflow and reverb are mismatched.  For example, if you are using the python
package 'tf-nightly', make sure you use the python package 'dm-reverb-nightly'
built on the same or the next night.  If you are using a release version package
'tensorflow', use a release package 'dm-reverb' built to be compatible with
that exact version.  If all else fails, file a github issue on deepmind/reverb.
Current installed version of tensorflow: 2.17.0.

Orignal error:
/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/reverb/libschema_cc_proto.so: undefined symbol: scc_info_TensorProto_tensorflow_2fcore_2fframework_2ftensor_2eproto
```

## Steps Taken to Troubleshoot
1. **Reinstallation of TensorFlow and `dm-reverb`**:
   - Uninstalled TensorFlow and `dm-reverb`.
   - Cleared the pip cache.
   - Reinstalled TensorFlow (version 2.17.0) and `dm-reverb` (version 0.8.0).

2. **Setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**:
   - Ensured that the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable was set correctly to include the paths to the TensorFlow and `reverb` libraries.

3. **Attempting to Import `reverb` Outside of the Test Environment**:
   - Ran a Python shell command to import `reverb` independently of the test environment to isolate the issue.
   - The ImportError persisted, indicating that the issue is not specific to the test environment.

## System Environment Details
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu
- **Python Version**: 3.10.12
- **TensorFlow Version**: 2.17.0
- **dm-reverb Version**: 0.8.0
- **Other Relevant Packages**:
  - `jax`
  - `jaxlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `six`

## Next Steps
Given the consistent failure to resolve the issue through the steps taken, and considering the error message's suggestion to file a GitHub issue on deepmind/reverb if all else fails, we are preparing to seek external support from the library maintainers.

We will file a GitHub issue on the deepmind/reverb repository, providing the details documented here, and request assistance in resolving the compatibility issue between `reverb` and TensorFlow.
