# Dependencies for Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

To develop advanced reasoning capabilities using graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, the following dependencies have been identified from the Optax library:

Core Dependencies:
- absl-py: Version 0.7.1 or higher
- chex: Version 0.1.86 or higher
- jax: Version 0.4.27 or higher
- jaxlib: Version 0.4.27 or higher
- numpy: Version 1.18.0 or higher
- etils[epy]

Additional Dependencies for Testing:
- dm-tree: Version 0.1.7 or higher
- flax: Version 0.5.3 or higher
- scipy: Version 1.7.1 or higher
- scikit-learn

Dependencies for Running Examples:
- tensorflow-datasets: Version 4.2.0 or higher
- tensorflow: Version 2.4.0 or higher
- dp_accounting: Version 0.4 or higher
- ipywidgets
