# Placeholder for the lax module within the NextGenJax package

# The lax module in JAX contains functions for linear algebra and other numerical computations.
# Here we define placeholders for some of the core functionalities that might be expected from the lax module.

def placeholder_function():
    # Placeholder function to demonstrate the structure of the lax module
    pass

# Placeholder for commonly used linear algebra functions
def dot(x, y):
    # Placeholder for the dot product function
    pass

def conv_general_dilated(lhs, rhs, window_strides, padding, lhs_dilation=None, rhs_dilation=None, dimension_numbers=None, feature_group_count=1, batch_group_count=1, precision=None):
    # Placeholder for the general dilated convolution function
    pass

# Add more placeholder functions or classes as needed to mimic the structure of JAX's lax module
