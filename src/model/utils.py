# Pseudocode for advanced memory processing layer
# - Utilize attention mechanisms to enhance memory retention and recall
# - Implement a mechanism for dynamic memory allocation based on input complexity
# - Integrate a system for long-term and short-term memory differentiation

# Pseudocode for complex decision-making component
# - Develop a decision tree or rule-based system for logical reasoning
# - Incorporate probabilistic reasoning with Bayesian networks
# - Leverage reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making based on feedback

# Once the pseudocode is outlined, the actual logic will be implemented in the CustomTestModel class.
